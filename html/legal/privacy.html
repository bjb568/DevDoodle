<h1>DevDoodle Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Personally identifiable information, information that could be used to identify an individual, is only collected by DevDoodle when it is provided directly by a user posting to the site. We do not collect information that does not come from the user, for example IP addresses, browser fingerprints, and user interaction behaviors besides the time when a user makes a request to the site.</p>
<p>We do not collect data about users who are not logged in.</p>
<p>If a user has publicly posted personally identifiable information and wants to retract it, DevDoodle provides the option of deleting the post which contains it, which in effect restricts viewing of the post so as to make the personally identifiable information not be public.</p>
<p>Posting personally identifiable information of another party without their expressed consent is prohibited.</p>
<p>No data provided by GitHub OAuth services are used except for the public email address and URI of the GitHub profile picture.</p>
<p>No cookies are used by DevDoodle other than a session ID. The session ID is not recorded unless it corresponds to a logged in user.</p>
