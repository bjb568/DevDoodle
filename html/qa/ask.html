		<h2>How to ask</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Make sure your question can be answered, not just discussed.</li>
			<li>Try to learn something new, don't just ask others to solve your problems.</li>
			<li>Ask <em>how</em> to do something, not for a library or other pre-existing code that can do it.</li>
			<li>Be deatiled when explaining your problem, also include what you tried to solve it.</li>
			<li><strong>Is your question specifically about programming?</strong><br />Ask about the site itself on meta.</li>

		<h2>Writing a good title</h2>
		<p>Your question's title is the first thing seen by readers skimming thru questions both here and on search engines. A title effectively capture the essence of the question. Try to avoid titles like:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>"Is it possible to…"</strong> (you want to know <em>how</em> to do something)</li>
			<li><strong>X in [some language]</strong> (what about <em>X</em>?)</li>
			<li><strong>"XYZ error"</strong> (when doing <em>what?</em>)</li>
			<li><strong>"Should I…"</strong> or <strong>"Is … a good idea?"</strong> (describe the <em>problem</em>, not the attempted (or not) solution)</li>
			<li><strong>"Is X or Y better?"</strong> (in <em>what way?</em>)</li>
			<li><strong>"Should I use X or Y?"</strong> (<em>"Is X or Y better at… ?"</em> is a better phrasing that doesn't depend on your specific circumstances)</li>
			<li><strong>"How can I replicate [some feature]?"</strong> (say what specifically you need help with accomplishing keeping in mind that not as many people as you'd think know about [some feature])</li>
			<li><strong>"Is this code good?"</strong> (be <em>specific</em> about what coding practice you want to learn more about)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Remember to keep it as short and concise as possible while still accurately describing the problem.</p>

		<h2>Explaining your problem</h2>
		<p>In the description box, you want to describe your problem in detail. <em>Include any information needed to setup the environment, replicate the bug, or observe the problematic behavior.</em> Be <strong>clear</strong> about what exactly you did, struggled with, and would like us to help with. The core question box is for your specific request <em>in one well-written sentence</em>, for example "How can I flow foo thru bar?".</p>

		<h2>Adding relevant code</h2>
		<p>What code showcases the problem you're asking about? You'll want to make it easy to run the code and locate the issue (whatever it might be), but too much code can be hard to debug and understand. A good way of finding out what's going on in your code is to comment out a few lines at a time until you either have very little code or the problem has gone away. If you can fix it by yourself this way, that's great! But even if you can't, you've narrowed down the code that may contain the culprit and now have a succinct snippet of code to share with us. <strong>After isolating the problem, you should have a small code snippit that reproduces the issue, generally under 48 lines.</strong> Make sure you take out sensitive information and clean up the code before posting it here.</p>
