		<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>
		<div id="quality-b">
			<p>To facilitate our goal of creating content that is useful to the greater community, we have very strict quality standards. This is not a discussion forum: All posts should be on-topic and <em>helpful to as many people as possible</em>.</p>

					<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" id="up" width="22" height="24" fill="#f90"><polygon points="10,1 1,19 19,19" /></svg>
					Upvote helpful and interesting posts to increase their visibility and signal that they're useful.
				</li>

					Downvote unhelpful or harmful posts to decrease their visibility and discourage similar behavior. If they can be improved, consider suggesting improvements by commenting or <em>editing</em> yourself.

					Flag posts with serious problems so they can be dealt with by privileged users.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Programs that primarily serve a non-programming related purpose will be removed.</p>
			<h3>Editing</h3>
			<p>Questions and answers can be edited by the community to correct mistakes. We encourage editing whenever you see a fixable problem with a post.</p>
			<p>Tho programs can't be directly edited, they can be forked to add functionality. Forking a program creates an editable clone of it owned by the forker.</p>

		<h2 id="community">Community</h2>
		<div id="community-b">
			<p>Almost everything that is done on DevDoodle is a community process. The community casts votes on site policies and moderation of posts, community members help each other by solving their problems and collaborating on projects, and users can posts feature requests on <em>meta</em> to add site functionality for the benefit of the community.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Try to give to the community more than you receive.</li>
				<li>Don't feel entitled to anything â€“ everyone is donating their own time.</li>
				<li>Respect other's time by cutting out <em>noise</em> from your posts.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Commenting</h3>
			<p>Comment on any post to ask for more information or suggest improvements. You can always comment on your own post, but you need 50 reputation to comment on others'.</p>
			<p>Try to avoid extended discussion in comments: use a chatroom instead.</p>

		<h2 id="moderation">Moderation</h2>
		<div id="moderation-b">
			<p>The community self-moderates by reviewing post quality and improving salvageable content. Common moderation tasks are divided into queues which focus on specific goals such as improving content, correcting user behavior, and evaluating content.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Overall content quality is improved thru recategorization, broadening, and correcting language, technical, and formatting issues.</li>
				<li>Behavior rules are enforced by the community.</li>
				<li>Low quality posts are evaluated and dealt with in a democratic way where multiple reviewers cast their vote.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In this way, the community is able to keep a high quality standard with minimal moderator intervention.</p>
		</div>

	<div class="half">
		<h2 id="privleges">Privileges</h2>
		<div id="privleges-b">
			<p>As users become familiar to the site's functionality, practices, guidelines, and culture, privileges are granted for communication, reward, and moderation. Reputation is gained from votes on your posts.</p>
			<ul>
